The project objective is to use visualization concepts and techniques to transform data into a meaningful interactive dashboard that allows the final user to make well-informed decisions. The data used in our project comes from Inside Airbnb, a website that provides scrapped data from Airbnb. The data used concerns the Airbnb listings of Lisbon for the month of June 2019. The variables’ metadata is available under the data folder in the metadata file. In order to reach our objective, the project was developed and implemented using Python, particularly Plotly with Dash software.

The main objective of this project is to provide a useful application that helps Airbnb users to find their optimal listing according to their needs and constraints. This application is fully user-driven, providing easy and interactive tools for exploration of existing listings. 

Further work can be done to integrate this dashboard with historical and dynamically updated data from several locations besides Lisbon.

The application was deployed using Heroku and is available through the following link: https://datavis-proj.herokuapp.com/.
